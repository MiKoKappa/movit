## The movie database with non-conventional design

My first real React.JS project, which is using existing API - TMDB.
The app is not properly responsive and not all features are in it this day. It will be updated to be polished and satisfactory.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Features of the app

### Main page

The app main page displays curently trending movies cards with hover effects, which are links to single movie pages.

Another lists such as best rating movies comming soon!

### Single movie page

The page provides info such as title, subtitle, generes, release date, ratings, short description, poster and a movie trailer button, if such trailer exists. 
The trailer button opens up a modal box with a youtube player. The background of the page is an original movie backdrop.

### Searchbar

The whole site implements searchbar is header for quickly searching for the movie. It calls API for movie list with every keystroke, making it very interactive.

### Language changer

The language changer is a switch providing and storaging information about side language in local storage of the browser.
